All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away!
From all this pain in the world we made!

Every day you need a bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!

Sound it off, this is the call!
Rise in revolution!
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution!
Unite and fight, to make a better life!
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight we rise!

Rise
Tonight we rise
Rise
Tonight we rise!

Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone!
Faster than the blast of a car bomb!

And when the scars heal, the pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes!
Darkness fades away!
And the light shines on a brave new day!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!

Sound it off, this is the call!
Rise in revolution!
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution!
Unite and fight to make a better life!
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight we rise!

Rise
Tonight we rise
Rise
Tonight we rise!

In a world gone mad
In a place so sad!
Sometimes it's crazy
To fight for what you believe!
But you can't give up
If you wanna keep what you love!
(Keep what you love)
Keep what you love
(Keep what you love)
Keep what you love
Never give up, no!

Rise
Rise in revolution
Rise
Rise in revolution

Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call!

Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight we rise
Rise
Make a better life
Tonight we rise!

Rise, rise, rise in revolution
Rise, rise, rise in revolution
Rise
